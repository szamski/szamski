👋 Hi, I’m @szamski  
👀 I’m interested in building tools that solve real problems, especially in marketing tech and automation.  
🌱 I’m currently learning more about API integrations, monday.com apps, and backend architecture.  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on smart, useful projects – especially in the productivity, automation, and data space.
